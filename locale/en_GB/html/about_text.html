<p>WebTUT is a "Tutoring Application", where a teacher can "publish" a websnippet beside 
their on-line course or content and the student uses that to access the tutoring. The 
application provides a teacher interface that he can use from any device to talk with 
their students, allows him to define the tutoring time window, get information about 
the queued students and statistics about the sessions.</p>
